# CogniFlow
The Visual Playground for AI Minds


#Overview

CogniFlow is a visual, modular platform for designing and executing agentic AI systems. It provides a drag-and-drop interface where users can compose pipelines of AI modules—combining symbolic reasoning with machine learning—to build intelligent agents without deep coding expertise.

##Problem Statement

Building reliable AI agents today requires expertise across multiple domains like perception, knowledge representation, reasoning, planning, decision making, and action execution, along with handling learning and memory. Current tools are either too simplistic (focused mainly on LLM chaining) or too complex (requiring advanced programming skills), creating a barrier for researchers, engineers, and domain experts who want to prototype or deploy AI systems.

##Proposed Solution

CogniFlow introduces a visual IDE for agentic AI where intelligence is built by connecting modular components in a pipeline:

1. Perception to interpret text, images, or audio
2. Knowledge Representation to structure context and domain logic
3. Reasoning & Planning to infer and strategize
4. Decision Making to select optimal actions
5. Action modules to interact with the real world via APIs or automation
6. Learning to adapt over time
7. Memory to retain past experiences for continuity

By blending symbolic AI with modern ML, CogniFlow aims to democratize AI development and become the go-to platform for building, testing, and deploying intelligent agents.
