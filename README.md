# CogniFlow
### *The Visual Playground for AI Minds*



## Overview
CogniFlow is a visual, modular platform for designing and executing **agentic AI systems**. It provides an intuitive drag-and-drop canvas where users compose pipelines that blend **symbolic reasoning** (e.g., rules, Bayesian networks, planners) with **machine learning** (e.g., LLMs, CV models) to build intelligent agents without deep coding.

## Problem Statement
Building reliable agents spans multiple disciplines—**Perception, Knowledge Representation, Reasoning, Planning, Decision Making, Action**, plus **Learning** and **Memory**—and today’s tools are either LLM-chain specific or code-heavy. This complexity blocks researchers, engineers, and domain experts from quickly prototyping and deploying robust AI systems.

## Proposed Solution
CogniFlow introduces a **visual IDE for agentic AI** where intelligence is built by wiring modular components:
- **Perception** – interpret text, images, audio  
- **Knowledge Representation** – structure facts/contexts (graphs, BNs)  
- **Reasoning & Planning** – infer and strategize (rules, MDP/POMDP)  
- **Decision Making** – select optimal action under constraints  
- **Action** – execute via APIs, webhooks, code runners  
- **Learning** – adapt models/rules continuously  
- **Memory** – retain/replay experiences & state

By combining symbolic AI with modern ML, CogniFlow aims to democratize AI development and become the go-to platform to **design, test, and deploy** intelligent agents.
