**A Visual, Low-Code Platform for Building Agentic AI Systems. Drag, Drop, and Architect Intelligence.**

CogniFlow provides a node-based editor that allows you to visually compose complex AI agents by connecting modular components representing perception, knowledge, reasoning, and action. Move from conceptual diagrams to running AI systems without the boilerplate code.

## üß† The Vision

Traditional AI agent development is locked behind complex code. CogniFlow democratizes this process by providing a visual canvas to design an agent's cognitive architecture, making advanced AI accessible to researchers, engineers, and domain experts alike.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **üß© Visual Node-Based Editor:** Intuitive drag-and-drop interface built with ReactFlow.
*   **üîß Modular AI Components:** Build agents from reusable modules for Perception, Knowledge Representation (Bayesian Networks, Vector DBs), Reasoning (Variable Elimination, ReAct), Planning (MDPs), and Action.
*   **‚ö° Real-Time Execution Engine:** A powerful backend interpreter that runs your visual graph seamlessly.
*   **üõ°Ô∏è Safe Sandboxing:** Execute Python code and tools in a secure, containerized environment.
*   **üìö Example Library:** Hit the ground running with pre-built agents for research, data analysis, and automation.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.10+
*   Node.js 16+
*   An OpenAI API key (for LLM nodes)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/cogniflow.git
    cd cogniflow
    ```

2.  **Set up the Backend:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    uvicorn app.api:app --reload
    ```
    The API will be running at `http://localhost:8000`.

3.  **Set up the Frontend:**
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    npm start
    ```
    The UI will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

4.  **Open your browser** and start building!
