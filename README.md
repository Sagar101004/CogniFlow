### *The Visual Playground for AI Minds*

## Overview
CogniFlow is a visual, modular platform for designing and executing **agentic AI systems**. It provides an intuitive drag-and-drop canvas where users compose pipelines that blend **symbolic reasoning** (e.g., rules, Bayesian networks, planners) with **machine learning** (e.g., LLMs, CV models) to build intelligent agents without deep coding.

## Problem Statement
Building reliable agents spans multiple disciplinesâ€”**Perception, Knowledge Representation, Reasoning, Planning, Decision Making, Action**, plus **Learning** and **Memory**â€”and todayâ€™s tools are either LLM-chain specific or code-heavy. This complexity blocks researchers, engineers, and domain experts from quickly prototyping and deploying robust AI systems.

## Proposed Solution
CogniFlow introduces a **visual IDE for agentic AI** where intelligence is built by wiring modular components:
- **Perception** â€“ interpret text, images, audio  
- **Knowledge Representation** â€“ structure facts/contexts (graphs, BNs)  
- **Reasoning & Planning** â€“ infer and strategize (rules, MDP/POMDP)  
- **Decision Making** â€“ select optimal action under constraints  
- **Action** â€“ execute via APIs, webhooks, code runners  
- **Learning** â€“ adapt models/rules continuously  
- **Memory** â€“ retain/replay experiences & state

By combining symbolic AI with modern ML, CogniFlow aims to democratize AI development and become the go-to platform to **design, test, and deploy** intelligent agents.

## Current Status
- âœ… Ideation & design  
- ðŸ”„ Defining module contracts & runtime  
- ðŸ”œ Prototype (Python backend + React canvas)

## Roadmap
- [ ] MVP canvas (drag-and-drop, run, trace)
- [ ] Core modules: Perception â†” Action
- [ ] Symbolic reasoning (rules, BN) + planners
- [ ] ML modules (LLMs, CV)
- [ ] Module SDK & template gallery
- [ ] Safe execution: sandboxing, audit logs

# Contributing to CogniFlow

## How to contribute
1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch:
   - `git checkout -b feat/my-change`
2. Write clear commits and tests when relevant.
3. Run linters/formatters (black/ruff for Python, eslint/prettier for JS).
4. Open a Pull Request with context and screenshots when UI-related.

## Development (proposed)
- **Backend**: Python (FastAPI), tasks via worker (Celery/RQ)
- **Frontend**: React + React Flow (canvas)
- **Modules**: Python-first SDK with typed I/O contracts

## Code of Conduct
Be respectful and constructive. Assume good intent.
